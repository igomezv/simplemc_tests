In the directory **simplemc** you can run a set of toy models in order to test the nested samplers. 

Usage:

.. code-block:: bash

   python toyModels.py sampler toymodel nlivepoints accuracy

where sampler is one of the nested samplers avaiable in SuperMC and toymodel is one of {egg, ring, square, gauss, shells, square}.


For example, in the SimpleMC directory, you can run:

.. code-block:: bash
   :linenos:
   
   python examples/toyModels.py egg mnest 50 0.5


As output you will obtain a text file with the samples, a summary and a plot.
