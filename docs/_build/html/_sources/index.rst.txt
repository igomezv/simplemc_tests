About
-------------

This is the documentation for SuperMC a bayesian code for cosmological parameter estimation and model comparison.

* :doc:`First steps and installation <intro>`.

* :doc:`Samplers and analyzers <samplers>` describes the samplers and analyzers in SuperMC.


We have gathered great previous codes made by others and put them to work together in the cosmological context. In particular, we use the following codes:

   * `SimpleMC <https://github.com/ja-vazquez/SimpleMC>`_ written by Anže Slosar and Jose Vazquez. This is the previous version of SuperMC and both have roughly the same structure.  
   * `Nestle <http://kylebarbary.com/nestle/>`_ developed by Kyle Barbary. This contains Ellipsoidal Nested Sampling and Multinest.
   * `MCEvidence <https://github.com/yabebalFantaye/MCEvidence>`_ by Yabebal Fantaye. This code allows us to estimate bayesian evidence since the chains produced by a Metropolis-Hastings. 
   * `pyBambi <https://pybambi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ by Will Handley . We use the set of Neural Networks of this code to provide at the Nestle samplers to Neural Networks. 
   * `Corner <https://corner.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_ by Daniel Foreman-Mackey. This library is for create smooth corner plots. 
   * `Getdist <https://getdist.readthedocs.io>`_ by Antony Lewis. A package for analysing and plotting Monte Carlo (or other) samples
