Parameter estimation to CPL parameterisation
=============================================

In this post we show how perform Bayesian inference (parameter estimation) to the Dark Energy parameterisation known as Chevalier-Polansky-Linder (CPL) without curvature using SN-Ia and cosmic chronometers. There are two options to make parameter estimation through Bayesian inference in ``SimpleMC``: 


  * :ref:`mcmc`

  * :ref:`nested`



..  _mcmc:

With Metropolis-sampling algorithm
------------------------------------

If you want to use external data with an existing ``SimpleMC`` model, you can set it in the ``ini file`` using ``h``, ``fs8`` or ``distance_mod`` cosmological functions in the key ``fn``:

.. code-block:: bash

	[custom]
	...

	model = waCDM

	datasets = SN+HD
	analyzer = mcmc
	...
	[mcmc]
	nsamp = 10000
	...

..  _nested:


With nested sampling algorithms
--------------------------------

In this case, we need to make a Python script instead to use the ``ini file`` and combine the  `simple model independent of any cosmology <simple_model.html#simple-model-independent-of-any-cosmology>`_ with new data

.. code-block:: bash

	[custom]
	...

	model = waCDM

	datasets = SN+HD
	analyzer = nested

	...
	
	[nested]
	nlive = 100
	dlogz = 0.1
