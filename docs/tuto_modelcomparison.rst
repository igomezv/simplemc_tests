Model comparison with Bayesian evidence
========================================

[Section in process...]

In this post we show how to perform model comparison between two models (:math:`\Lambda CDM` and CPL) with Bayesian inference using the Bayesian evidence obtained by nested sampling.  

.. math::

	P(D)=\int_{\mathbb{R}^N} P(D|\theta)P(\theta)d\theta,
