# simpleMC

Personal copy of the SimpleMC cosmological parameter estimation code. The original source, where the latest stable version is located, is in the repository of Dr. José Alberto Vázquez: https://github.com/ja-vazquez/SimpleMC 

Temporary documentation in: https://igomezv.github.io/SimpleMC/ 

In this current repository I do some personal tests and experiments before contributing to the original source. 

Any question or suggestion please contact me.

TO DO:
