# simpleMC

Personal copy of the `SimpleMC` cosmological parameter estimation code. The original source, where the latest stable version is located, is in the repository of Dr. José Alberto Vázquez: https://github.com/ja-vazquez/SimpleMC 

In the `docs` directory are all the files used by the `sphinx` library to build the website with the `SimpleMC` temporary documentation: https://igomezv.github.io/SimpleMC/ 

In this current repository I do some personal tests and experiments before contributing to the original source. 

Any question or suggestion please contact me.

TO DO:

- Prints of Pantheon likelihood.
- Add warnings in bad combinations of RC and Simple likelihoods with some models.
- Unify pybambi and nerualike.
- Neural networks methods with dynesty multiprocessing fails.
